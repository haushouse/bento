I am a digital designer and passionate photographer based in Oregon. While seeking to expand my skillsets, I am currently focused on branding, creating visual identities, and user interfaces.

While studying at Oregon State University, I created promotional deliverables for University Housing & Dining Services. This helped students and visitors navigate around campus events, and incoming freshman find their place on campus. My role was essential in fast tracking the transition from in-person to digital experiences during the global pandemic.

Aside from design, I enjoy traveling, which sparked my passion for photography. Check out my portfolio and resume to learn more about the work I’ve done.
